                            <p>
                                
                                Isolation is when a person who is experiencing infectious diseases such as COVID-19 symptoms
                                stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places.
                                This can be voluntarily or based on his/her doctor’s recommendation.

                                Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves 
                                but may have been exposed to COVID-19. 
                                The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms..

                                COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.
                                 This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, 
                                in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

                            <h4>What is social distancing?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Social distancing means being physically apart. 
                                WHO recommends keeping at least 6 feet distance from others.
                                This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well
                                with no known exposure to COVID-19. 
                            </p>

                            <h4>How long does it take after exposure to COVID-19 to develop symptoms?</h4>
                            <p>
                                The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start
                                 is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 – 14 days.
                            </p>

                            <h4>How long does COVID-19 survive on surfaces?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 
                                72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours
                                on cardboard.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Are antibiotics a means of treating COVID-19?</h4>
                            <p>
                                No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. 
                                COVID-19 is caused by a virus, 
                                so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of 
                                prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
